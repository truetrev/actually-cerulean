┃   You go to your closet and you select, I don't know, that lumpy blue       ┃
┃   sweater, for instance, because you're trying to tell the world that you   ┃
┃   take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back.      ┃
┃                                                                             ┃
┃   But what you don't know is that that sweater is not just blue, it's not   ┃
┃   turquoise, it's not lapis, it's actually cerulean."                       ┃
